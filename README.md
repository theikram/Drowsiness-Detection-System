# üöó Driver Drowsiness Detection System

### üß† *An AI-powered real-time system that monitors drivers‚Äô eyes and mouth using webcam or phone camera to detect drowsiness and alert them instantly.*

---

## üöÄ Overview

The **Driver Drowsiness Detection System** is a Python-based **Flask Web Application** that detects a person‚Äôs drowsiness in real time using **OpenCV** and **Dlib**.  
It continuously tracks the driver‚Äôs **eye closure** and **yawning** patterns using either a **webcam** or a **mobile camera feed**.  
When it detects signs of fatigue, it triggers an **audio alarm** to instantly alert the user, preventing potential accidents.  

The project focuses on **road safety** through a **low-cost, real-time solution** that doesn‚Äôt require any special hardware ‚Äî just a camera and Python.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the Project Works

This project is a **Drowsiness Detection System** built as a Python **Flask** web app. It combines a user-friendly web interface with computer vision processing in the backend.

### Step-by-step Workflow:

1. **Start the Server:**  
   Run `app.py` to launch the local Flask server.

2. **Open the Web App:**  
   Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in a browser.

3. **Select Camera Source:**  
   Choose between:
   - **Run Using Webcam** ‚Äì uses your laptop camera.  
   - **Run Using Phone Cam** ‚Äì streams from your Android phone via IP.

4. **Real-time Detection:**  
   - Uses a pre-trained Dlib model `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` to find **eyes** and **mouth**.
   - Calculates **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** for eye closure.  
   - Calculates **Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR)** for yawning detection.

5. **Alert System:**  
   - If **EAR** drops below threshold ‚Üí Eyes closed ‚Üí Audio Alert plays.  
   - If **MAR** rises above threshold ‚Üí Yawn detected ‚Üí Warning plays.

6. **Exit:**  
   Press `q` to quit the camera window and return to the web app.

## üåê Website Page Descriptions

### üè† 1. Home Page  
Landing page with:
- A welcoming banner for the project.
- Three info cards:
  - **Causes of Drowsiness**
  - **Symptoms**
  - **Preventions**

### üéØ 2. Detect Drowsiness  
Main control page that lets the user:
- Start the detection.
- Choose between **webcam** or **phone camera** input.

### üìò 3. Understanding Drowsiness  
Educational page describing:
- **What causes drowsiness**
- **How it affects drivers**
- **Tips to prevent fatigue**

### üí§ 4. Levels of Drowsiness  
Defines the detection levels:
- **Alert**
- **Slightly Drowsy**
- **Moderately Drowsy**
- **Very Drowsy**
- **Asleep**  

This page also mentions how the **EAR** value helps decide the drowsiness level.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 5. How It Works  
Explains the full tech stack:
- **Backend:** Flask  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Processing:** OpenCV, Dlib, Numpy, Imutils  
- Includes the overall workflow and architecture diagram.

## üí° Motivation

Drowsy driving is a leading cause of traffic accidents worldwide.  
Traditional monitoring systems are expensive and limited to high-end vehicles.  
This project aims to **bring an affordable and accessible solution** using just a camera and open-source tools.

## üî¨ Working Principle

1. **Facial Landmark Detection**
   Uses the `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` model to locate facial key points.

2. **EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio)**
   Measures the eye openness; a drop below threshold signals closed eyes.

3. **MAR (Mouth Aspect Ratio)**
   Measures how wide the mouth opens; higher value indicates yawning.

4. **Audio Alert**
   Triggers using `pygame.mixer` to play warning sounds.

5. **Real-Time Display**
   Runs via Flask routes like `/video_feed`, streaming live video with detection overlays.
